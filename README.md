# Ethereum PoS demo

This project is an attempt to explain Ethereum Mauve Paper (https://cdn.hackaday.io/files/10879465447136/Mauve%20Paper%20Vitalik.pdf) in an interactive and hopefully easy-to-understand way. 
You can read about why I made it [here](https://medium.com/@tim.sh/why-i-created-ethereum-proof-of-stake-demo-3e469ecfbe8e).\
It was created entirely using React, with Cursor in a role of coder and ChatGPT 4o as a technical project manager that wrote instructions and documentation for Cursor. 
I (almost) haven't wrote a single line of code myself. 
You can read about how I did it in detail here (coming soon).

Information below is +- copied from a basic react app README:
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to gh-pages (Github Pages). But it didn't work for me a couple of times, so I manually deployed it by pushing /build floder to the "gh-pages" branch.
